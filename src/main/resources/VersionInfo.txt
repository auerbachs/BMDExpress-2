 BMDExpress 2.3
</h1>


<h2>Version <MAJOR_VERSION> BUILD <SUBVERSION_VERSION_NUMBER> released on August 8, 2024</h2>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue flagging hill models when BMD is below the lowest dose. Previously the application interpreted 1/3 as 1/4 and 1/2 as 1/3 due to a bug creating the flag hill ratio value.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fix on August 16, 2023
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue when running multiple One Way Anova analyses causing LOTEL/NOTEL 
calculation to shuffle p-value and fold change parameters in GUI. This was not
an issue when running one dataset at a time and in the command line version </li>
<li>Fixed issue cause by invalid default folder path for exporting and importing data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on July 15, 2020

<ul>
<li>Improved performance of Williams Trend Test</li>
</ul>


<h3>
New Features on July 15, 2020
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The code has been updated to be compatible with OpenJDK 11.  The new releases will come with embedded OpenJDK 11 JREs.</li>
</ul>

Bug Fixes on released on June 9, 2020
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
When the user selected and specified a value for "Remove Genes with BMD/BMDL >" AND/OR "Remove Genes with BMU/BMD >" to filter out 
When the user selected and specified a value for "Remove Genes with BMD/BMDL >" AND/OR "Remove Genes with BMDU/BMD >" to filter out 
genes while filling out the input form for 
Functional Classification, the user specified value(s) were actually compared to BMDU/BMDL of the Best Model for the BMD Analysis result
 for the gene/probe.
 This issue has been corrected.
</li>

<li>The first two non-header lines of the category input file were being ignored when performing Defined Category Analysis.
This issue has been fixed.</li>
</ul>



<h3>
Bug Fixes on January 17, 2020
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fisher's Exact Test was not working correctly when "Eliminate Gene Set Redundancy" was selected.  This issue has been fixed.</li>
	
	
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on January 15, 2020
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The IVIVE chemical table has been updated to contain information about the source of the parameters that are read and used to to auto-populate the text fields.</li>
<li>The Category Analysis output table has been updated to contain the a,b,c and d parameters used for the Fisher's Exact Test calculations.</li>
<li>The b parameter of the Fisher's Exact Test is now based on the number of genes with BMD values that passed the category analysis filters.  Previously it was based on the number of genes with BMD values disregarding the filters applied prior to running the analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>LOTEL and NOTEL values were not populated in the results during the prefilter analysis if the LOTEL was supposed to be the last dose group.  This has been corrected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on December 17, 2019

<ul>
<li>IVIVE analysis over 700,000 chemicals and properties using HTTK</li>
<li>Sciome GCurveP for non-parametric dose-response modeling</li>
<li>LOTEL/NOTEL calculation using Dunnettâ€™s test or Student T-Test</li>
<li>Individual gene category analysis</li>
<li>Integration of BioPlanet into the Signaling Pathway Analysis</li>
<li>Hide/Show table columns</li>
<li>Copy/Paste table rows</li>
<li>Venn diagram chart viewer for prefilter analysis results</li>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on October 30, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Williams Trend Test prefilter was returning p-values greater than 1 for genes with little to no signal.  This caused genes to be filtered out even when user selected "None" for p-value in the input window.  This problem has been fixed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>
Bug Fixes on September 27, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Selecting Best Poly Model using lowest AIC was not working correctly. This has been an issue since version 1.  The issue has been corrected. </li>
<li>Command line version only:  Flag hill at 1/3 or 1/2 the lowest positive doses were mixed up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on July 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to export charts to SVG.  Right click on chart, Export as, SVG...  This is a vector graphics format and allows you to resize to any resolution. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on June 25, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The command line version now allows you to specify a folder for the base path.  The base path is by default stored in your home folder under "bmdexpress2."  By customizing the base path, the command line analysis can be distributed across multiple compute nodes while localizing disk access when running many instances in massive parallel.</li>

</ul>


<h3>
New Features on June 21, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The command line version now allows you to specify a folder where temporary files will be stored during the BMDS model execution process.  The same temporary folder will also be used to store a copy of the model executables.  This new feature enhances the ability for the software to perform very large scale analyses across multiple machines in a compute cluster environment.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
New Features on June 13, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temp file names are now more complex and unique across multiple instances of the application running.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
New Features on April 17, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polynomial models with degree >1 are now run in both adverse directions. The model with the lowest BMD is then chosen as the representative model. This change represents a return to the analysis protocol that was used in BMDExpress v1 and v2.0 and ensures the selection of the most sensitive BMD for each polynomial model with degree >1.   </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on April 17, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue to allow exponential models to correctly parse the log likelihood values from bmds output file. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatically clean up hidden temporary files when starting the application.  </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue related to not being able to save BMD Analysis configuration to auto-populate fields. </li>
<li>Fixed issue that was causing prefilter values to not be recognized in the BMD Analysis result during functional analysis. </li>
<li>We have stopped using the probe names to name temp files for bmds models because they can be unpredictable.  We switched to using a random string to name these files to help avoid OS related file name problems. </li>

</ul>


<h3>
New Features released on March 22, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added better capabilties to control model timeouts when performing BMD Analysis. </li>
<li>Added run times to the analysis notes for all analyses. </li>

</ul>


<h3>

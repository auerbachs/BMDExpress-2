BMDExpress-2.0
==============
Software uses the US EPA dose-response models from the BMDS software to analyze high dimensional dose-response data, in particular gene expression data. The outputs of the software are gene and gene set level benchmark dose values. 
Jason Phillips (jason.phillips@sciome.com) was the software engineer on BMDExpress 2.0 and Dan Svoboda (Dan.Svoboda@sciome.com) was the primary design engineer. Scott Auerbach (auerbachs@niehs.nih.gov) led the project team.
The software is derivation of efforts by Longlong Yang (longlong.yang@nih.gov) that was originally released in 2007. (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-8-387).
BMDExpress 1.0 is available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmdexpress/ .
Details on the US EPA BMDS software can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/bmds .

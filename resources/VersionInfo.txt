<h1>
 BMDExpress 2.2
</h1>

<h2>Version <MAJOR_VERSION> BUILD <SUBVERSION_VERSION_NUMBER> released on September 27, 2018</h2>


<h3>
Bug Fixes on September 27, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Selecting Best Poly Model using lowest AIC was not working correctly. This has been an issue since version 1.  The issue has been corrected. </li>
<li>Command line version only:  Flag hill at 1/3 or 1/2 the lowest positive doses were mixed up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on July 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to export charts to SVG.  Right click on chart, Export as, SVG...  This is a vector graphics format and allows you to resize to any resolution. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on June 25, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The command line version now allows you to specify a folder for the base path.  The base path is by default stored in your home folder under "bmdexpress2."  By customizing the base path, the command line analysis can be distributed across multiple compute nodes while localizing disk access when running many instances in massive parallel.</li>

</ul>


<h3>
New Features on June 21, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The command line version now allows you to specify a folder where temporary files will be stored during the BMDS model execution process.  The same temporary folder will also be used to store a copy of the model executables.  This new feature enhances the ability for the software to perform very large scale analyses across multiple machines in a compute cluster environment.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
New Features on June 13, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Temp file names are now more complex and unique across multiple instances of the application running.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
New Features on April 17, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polynomial models with degree >1 are now run in both adverse directions. The model with the lowest BMD is then chosen as the representative model. This change represents a return to the analysis protocol that was used in BMDExpress v1 and v2.0 and ensures the selection of the most sensitive BMD for each polynomial model with degree >1.   </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on April 17, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue to allow exponential models to correctly parse the log likelihood values from bmds output file. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatically clean up hidden temporary files when starting the application.  </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue related to not being able to save BMD Analysis configuration to auto-populate fields. </li>
<li>Fixed issue that was causing prefilter values to not be recognized in the BMD Analysis result during functional analysis. </li>
<li>We have stopped using the probe names to name temp files for bmds models because they can be unpredictable.  We switched to using a random string to name these files to help avoid OS related file name problems. </li>

</ul>


<h3>
New Features released on March 22, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added better capabilties to control model timeouts when performing BMD Analysis. </li>
<li>Added run times to the analysis notes for all analyses. </li>

</ul>


<h3>
New Major Release 2.2
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Williams Trend Test and Oriogen Prefilters were added as alternatives to One-Way ANOVA </li>
<li>Mark and label data points in charts </li>
<li>Create your own charts</li>
<li>Edit chart properties</li>
<li>View multiple curves on same plot</li>
<li>PCA Plots for viewing expression data</li>
<li>Enhanced filtering capabilities</li>
<li>Command line version </li>
<li>Combine multiple anlayses for easier visualization and export</li>
<li>Export and import project files as JSON</li>
<li>You can now add projects to an existing project</li>
<li>Many new metrics in grids</li>
<li>Many new pre-analyis filters </li>
</ul>

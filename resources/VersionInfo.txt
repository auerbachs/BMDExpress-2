<h1>
 BMDExpress 2.2
</h1>

<h2>Version <MAJOR_VERSION> BUILD <SUBVERSION_VERSION_NUMBER> released on April 17, 2018</h2>


<h3>
New Features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Polynomial models with degree >1 are now run in both adverse directions. The model with the lowest BMD is then chosen as the representative model. This change represents a return to the analysis protocol that was used in BMDExpress v1 and v2.0 and ensures the selection of the most sensitive BMD for each polynomial model with degree >1.   </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue to allow exponential models to correctly parse the log likelihood values from bmds output file. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
New Features on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatically clean up hidden temporary files when starting the application.  </li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes on April 9, 2018
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue related to not being able to save BMD Analysis configuration to auto-populate fields. </li>
<li>Fixed issue that was causing prefilter values to not be recognized in the BMD Analysis result during functional analysis. </li>
<li>We have stopped using the probe names to name temp files for bmds models because they can be unpredictable.  We switched to using a random string to name these files to help avoid OS related file name problems. </li>

</ul>
